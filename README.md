# AMaze

A lightweight maze navigation task generator for sighted AI agents

## Current state

No clear distinction between library code (maze generator, viewer, stats extractor, ...)
and user code (experiments, training protocols, results generation, ...).
Dependency on stable baselines 3, should (will) be optional.

Install with
```
git clone https://github.com/kgd-al/amaze.git
cd amaze
source ../<virtual_environment>/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Patch requests are welcome.

## Documentation

Patchy at best. Should be improved upon in the coming months.

## Examples

Same. No nice examples are provided (yet!).
